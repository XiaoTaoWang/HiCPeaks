Overview
========
*hicpeaks* comes with 6 scripts: *toCooler*, *pyBHFDR*, *pyHICCUPS*, *combine-resolutions*, *peak-plot* and *apa-analysis*.

- toCooler

  Store TXT/NPZ bin-level Hi-C data into `cooler <https://github.com/mirnylab/cooler>`_ container.

  1. I have included a sample data with *hicpeaks* source code to illustrate how you should prepare your
     data in TXT format. It's quite easy, just remember 3 points: 1. the file name should follow this pattern
     "chrom1_chrom2.txt" (remove prefix from your chromosome labels, i.e. "chr1" should be "1", and "chrX" should
     be "X"); 2. each file should only contain 3 columns, corresponding to "bin1" of "chrom1", "bin2" of "chrom2",
     and "contact frequency" (**don't** perform any normalization processes); 3. all files at the same resolution
     should be placed under a single folder.
  2. NPZ format is another bin-level Hi-C data container which can extremely speed up data loading. *hicpeaks*
     supports NPZ files generated by old version of `runHiC (<0.8.0) <https://github.com/XiaoTaoWang/HiC_pipeline>`_ and
     `TADLib (<0.4.0) <https://github.com/XiaoTaoWang/TADLib>`_.

- pyBHFDR

  A CPU-based python implementation for BH-FDR algorithm. Rao et al (2014) states in their supplementary material that
  this algorithm is robust enough to obtain all main results of their paper. Compared with HiCCUPS, BH-FDR doesn't use
  λ-chunk in multiple hypothesis test, and only considers the Donut background region when calculating the
  expected values.

- pyHICCUPS

  A CPU-based python implementation for HiCCUPS algorithm. Besides the donut region, HiCCUPS also considers the
  lower-left, vertical and horizontal backgrounds when calculating the expected values. And λ-chunk is used to overcome
  several multiple hypothesis testing challenges for Hi-C data. Finally, while BH-FDR has to limit the detected pixels
  near the diagonal (<2Mb), HiCCUPS is able to generalize itself to any genomic distance in theory. Here, *pyHICCUPS*
  keeps all main concepts of the original algorithm except for these points:

  1. *pyHICCUPS* excludes vertical and horizontal backgrounds from its calculation.
  2. There are two critical parameters related to the loop definition in HiCCUPS: the peak width *p* and the donut width *w*.
     In original implementation, they are set exclusively for each certain resolution, specifically, *p=1* and *w=3* at 25Kb,
     *p=2* and *w=5* at 10Kb, and *p=4* and *w=7* at 5Kb. To improve the sensitivity, *pyHICCUPS* calculates and outputs
     the union of the peak calls from all parameter settings *(1,3)*, *(2,5)*, *(4,7)* in a single run.
  3. Due to computational complexity, you should still limit the genomic distance of 2 loci to some degree (5Mb/10Mb).

- combine-resolutions

  Combine peak calls from different resolutions in a way similar to original *HiCCUPS*. Briefly, it excludes redundant lower
  resolution peaks while filters out low-confidence high resolution peaks.

- peak-plot

  Visualize peaks (or loops) detected by *pyBHFDR* or *pyHICCUPS* on heatmap. Just provide a cooler file, a loop
  annotation file in *bedpe* format, and input your interested region (chrom, start, end).

- apa-analysis

  Perform Aggregate Peak Analysis (APA). The inputs are a Hi-C matrix in *.cool* format and a loop annotation file in
  *.bedpe* format.


QuickStart
==========
This tutorial will guide you through the basic usage of all scripts distributed with *hicpeaks*.

toCooler
--------
If you have already created a cooler file for your Hi-C data, skip to the next section
`pyBHFDR and pyHICCUPS <https://github.com/XiaoTaoWang/HiCPeaks/blob/master/README.rst#pybhfdr-and-pyhiccups>`_,
go on otherwise.

First, you should store your TXT/NPZ bin-level Hi-C data into a cooler file by using *toCooler*. Let's begin
with our sample data below. Suppose you are still in the *hicpeaks* distribution root folder: change your current
working directory to the sub-folder *example*::

    $ cd example
    $ ls -lh *

    -rw-r--r--  1 xtwang  staff    18B Aug 21 19:46 datasets
    -rw-r--r--  1 xtwang  staff   293B Aug 23 20:53 hg38.chromsizes

    40K:
    total 11608
    -rw-r--r--  1 xtwang  staff   2.7M Aug 21 19:44 21_21.txt
    -rw-r--r--  1 xtwang  staff   2.9M Aug 21 19:44 22_22.txt

There are one sub-directory called *40K* which contains Hi-C data of two chromosomes in K562 cell line at 40K resolution,
and one metadata file *datasets* which we can pass directly to *toCooler*::

    $ cd 40K
    $ head -5 21_21.txt

    250	251	1
    250	258	1
    250	259	1
    250	260	4
    250	261	2

    $ cd ..
    $ cat datasets

    res:40000
      ./40K

You should construct your TXT files (no head, no tail) with 3 columns, which indicate "bin1 of the 1st chromosome",
"bin2 of the 2nd chromosome" and "contact frequency" respectively. See `Overview <https://github.com/XiaoTaoWang/HiCPeaks#overview>`_
above.

To transform this data to *cooler* format, just run the command below::

    $ toCooler -O K562-MboI-parts.cool -d datasets --assembly hg38 --nproc 2

*toCooler* routinely fetch sizes of each chromosome from UCSC with the provided genome assembly name (here hg38).
However, if your reference genome is not holded in UCSC, you can also build a file like "hg38.chromsizes" in
current working directory, and pass the file path to the argument "--chromsizes-file".

Type ``toCooler`` with no arguments on your terminal to print detailed help information for each parameter.

For this datasets, *toCooler* will create a cooler file named "K562-MboI-parts.cool", and your data will be stored under
the URI "K562-MboI-parts.cool::40000".

This tutorial only illustrates a very simple case, in fact the metadata file may contain list of resolutions (if you
have data at different resolutions for the same cell line) and corresponding folder paths (both relative and absolute
path are accepted, and if your data are NPZ format, this path should point to the NPZ file)::

    res:10000
      /absoultepath/10K
    
    res:20000
      ../relativepath/20K
    
    res:40000
      /npzfile/anyprefix.npz

Then *toCooler* will generate a single cooler file storing all the specified data under different cooler URI:
"specified_cooler_path::10000", "specified_cooler_path::20000" and "specified_cooler_path::40000".

pyBHFDR and pyHICCUPS
---------------------
With cooler URI, you can perform peak annotation by *pyBHFDR* or *pyHICCUPS*::

    $ pyBHFDR -O K562-MboI-BHFDR-loops.txt -p K562-MboI-parts.cool::25000 -C 21 --pw 1 --ww 3

Or::

    $ pyHICCUPS -O K562-MboI-HICCUPS-loops.txt -p K562-MboI-parts.cool::25000 --pw 1 2 4 --ww 3 5 7 --only-anchors

Type ``pyBHFDR`` or ``pyHICCUPS`` on your terminal to print detailed help information for each parameter.

Before step to the next section, let's list the contents under current working directory again::

    $ ls -lh

    total 1744
    drwxr-xr-x  5 xtwang  staff   160B Sep  3 14:55 40K
    -rw-r--r--  1 xtwang  staff   3.9K Sep  3 14:58 BHFDR.log
    -rw-r--r--  1 xtwang  staff    17K Sep  3 14:59 HICCUPS.log
    -rw-r--r--  1 xtwang  staff    16K Sep  3 14:58 K562-MboI-BHFDR-loops.txt
    -rw-r--r--  1 xtwang  staff    19K Sep  3 14:59 K562-MboI-HICCUPS-loops.txt
    -rw-r--r--  1 xtwang  staff   704K Sep  3 14:57 K562-MboI-parts.cool
    -rw-r--r--  1 xtwang  staff    18B Sep  3 14:55 datasets
    -rw-r--r--  1 xtwang  staff   293B Sep  3 14:55 hg38.chromsizes
    -rw-r--r--  1 xtwang  staff    29K Sep  3 14:57 tocooler.log

Peak Visualization
------------------
Now, you can visualize BH-FDR and HICCUPS peak annotations on heatmap with *peak-plot*.

For BH-FDR peaks::

    $ peak-plot -O test-BHFDR.png --dpi 200 -p K562-MboI-parts.cool::25000 -I K562-MboI-BHFDR-loops.txt -C 21 -S 20700000 -E 23300000 --correct --skip-rows 1

The output figure should look like this:

.. image:: ./figures/test-BHFDR.png
        :align: center


For HICCUPS peaks::

    $ peak-plot -O test-HICCUPS.png --dpi 200 -p K562-MboI-parts.cool::25000 -I K562-MboI-HICCUPS-loops.txt -C 21 -S 20700000 -E 23300000 --correct --skip-row 1

And the output plot:

.. image:: ./figures/test-HICCUPS.png
        :align: center


Aggregate Peak Analysis
-----------------------
To inspect the overall loop patterns of the detected peaks, you can use the *apa-analysis* script::

    $ 

Combine different resolutions
-----------------------------
The inputs to *combine-resolutions* are loop annotation files (*bedpe*) at different resolutions. If an interaction
is detected as a peak in both resolutions, this script records the precise coordinates in finer resolutions and discards
the coarser resolution one. And a long-range (determined by the ``--min-dis`` parameter) peak call at high resolutions
(determined by the ``--good-res`` parameter) will be treated as a false positive if it could not be identified at lower
resolutions. Here's a *pseudo* command with 3 loop files at 5Kb, 10Kb, and 20Kb respectively::

    $ combine-resolutions -O K562-MboI-pyHICCUPS-combined.bedpe -p K562-MboI-pyHICCUPS-5K.txt K562-MboI-pyHICCUPS-10K.txt K562-MboI-pyHICCUPS-20K.txt -R 5000 10000 20000 -G 20000 -M 100000
